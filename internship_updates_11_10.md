	justin mast electric plant
		[[plant electrophysiology]]
		
		plant nervous systems as environmental sensors for data collection
		decoding of electrochemical signals from diverse plant species
		- Process and analyze continuous time series data (biosignals similar to EEG), which have been recorded  from plants, to decode meaningful patterns and insights about multiple randomly timed and overlapping multimodal stimuli in the plant’s environment.
	- Collaborate with experts across disciplines (botany, electrophysiology, and so on) to understand and improve the data analysis process.
	- Assist in the design of field trials and lab experiments.
	- Assist in designing our distributed experimentation and collaborative fieldwork initiatives.
	- Stay updated with the latest research in biosignal processing, machine learning, and related fields.

OMGOMGOMGOMG HONGXU RESPONDED TO ME
IM GOING TO MEET WITH HIM EITHER WEDNESDAY OR FRIDAY
Wednesday (Nov 15) from 2-3pm and 4-5pm
Also Friday (Nov 17) from 3pm to 5pm.

learn everything there is to know about mineral and what they do
get a bunch of background info about plant perception specifically, maybe some robotics
come up with a bunch of good questions for him
how can i best translate this into an internship??
