how do u guys plan to adapt the agriculture system to a changing climate and switch to a more sustainable path?
	crop breeding - can use this to get more climate resilient varieties (longer roots, more drought resistant)
	weeding - need less tractors and machinery, producing less co2
		can spot and identify them, but how are yall getting rid of weeds?
how do we really make agriculture resilient to changing climate?
	building off of geography specific features of the land
	understanding soil science, what crop and varieties will succeed in this specific region, mineral deficiencies and understanding the signs of nutrient deficiencies
i wonder, what can we do to leverage and incorporate the knowledge of farmers in the way we create insights? 
what are the feedback loops between mineral and the farmer?
	partnerships with driscolls, which makes sense, u can implement on farms
	wtf is this partnership w syngenta? using their seeds makes climate smart agriculture even harder because farmers cant evolve and breed them to the needs of their land
Syngenta
	how does this partnership work? when the rover's goal is to reduce inputs, doesnt this go a bit against syngenta's whole profit model? or are we promising that the inputs we use will be syngenta's, which is a new stream of customer flow for them 

however, since we can catch diseases much earlier on, is there a way we can prevent spread of the disease and increase resilience of the whole field without needed large scale pesticide application?
any modelling you guys are doing on microbial activity?
# specific to ai/data
**what kind of backend? do u guys try to resolve data types or get all the info in the same latent space?**
**what about soil health?**
**tried to implement multispectral imaging on the rover?**
**how do you enable the rover to see what is under the brush/leaves?**
**where are they getting data from?**
	landsat, usda, regional databases, info from their rover hardware
	they should get it from eddy covariance towers
**do u have advice for how i can find/collect information on land practices based on geography**
	i have eddy covariance data to look at carbon dioxide flux and photosynthesis for 47 sites in the us (few per state)
	
done anything for looking at stomata behavior? (really important for gas exchange / important to learn about how this changes wrt to global warming)
		influence CO2Â uptake into the leaf
		water loss due to transpiration
		 plant water status 
		leaf temperature
	trying to find whether or not different varieties of grapes has tight stomatal control (isohydric) or less efficient control (anisohydric)

can you do anything to analyze rates of pollination or speed up rates of self pollination (lighlty shaking the branch as the robot goes by) to figure out which plants need more help getting pollinated

the rover can observe, analyze, and model exactly whats going on in the field
**will u guys be working towards improving the robots ability to take action as well? since its already going through the whole field and classifying/analyzing exactly whats going on, it would save humans a lot of time and labor if it could just take care of the problem on the spot.** 
	is computation being down on the spot?
		microdose on pesticides and fungicides
		apply fertilizer
		inoculate and spread seeds
		harvest/prune
		improving flowers attraction to pollinators (uv marker in the inside of the flower, spraying something that attracts more pollinators)
		shaking plants so they can self pollinate better
	
CGIAR - from ur partnership with them, do u get data?


possible additions/implementations
	changing climate: heating, less water
		look at photosynthesis rates/stomatal opening/closure
	we could use less inputs/fertilizers
		save money 
	identify diseases to prevent crop failure

does the rover have geospatial information in it/like coordinates? in terms of crop breeding and selection, if it could send a farmer or breeder the exact coordinates of high candidate plants for seed saving, that could save them a lot of time
