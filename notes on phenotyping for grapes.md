[paper on better phenotyping methodologies ](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.718202/full#:~:text=Plant%20phenotyping%20is%20an%20emerging,of%20plant%20and%20crop%20breeding.)
definitions for drought tolerance in grapevine:
- maximum transpiration rate
- stomatal regulation (expressed as the relation between stomatal conductance and leaf water potential)
- turgor loss point
**- root volume**
	how the fuck do u measure this
stress distance - the amount of time that the plant withstands without watering before reaching critical water potential

Plant phenology and growth are largely driven by air temperature and soil water availability

issues of **increased temperature** and **decreased access to water**
	one sol: deficit irrigation
people looking for <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">autochthonous varieties</mark>, **a variety originating from an original terroir and adapted to a soil**
	basically adapted to the region
