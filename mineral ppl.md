Hello Jinmeng! My name is Abinaya and im a Berkeley student studying CS + agriculture, also doing biogeochemistry research at LBNL. I'm super curious what kinds of problems Mineral is tackling in agriculture after working really closely with a few startups and on research surrounding soil health and satellite imaging. Would you be willing to chat for 15 minutes and share your experience about the work and culture? Thank you so much for your time!!

Hello Tally! My name is Abinaya and I'm a UC Berkeley undergrad studying CS + Agriculture, also doing biogeochemistry research at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Over the summer I worked at an amazing agriculture R&D startup called Loam Bio and I'm super curious what kinds of problems Mineral is tackling in the space!  

We might actually have a lot of shared interests because I also used to work at a healthcare startup (Tomorrow Health) and am currently doing work in computational color, optics and image reconstruction with some professors :) Would you be willing to chat for 15 minutes about your background and experience at Mineral? Thank you so much for your time!!
