Hi John,

I hope the season is treating you well! I just wanted to check back in and update you on where I am in the recruiting process: I've been chatting with engineers at a couple frontier agriculture startups and it looks like I'll be finalizing where I'm going in the next month. With my growing knowledge building ML tools on top of hardware, I still think it would be amazing to learn from your team on a cross sectional project helping drive user insights from the Apple Watch or built in sensors on the recent iPhones. Where are you in terms of finding interns for your team this summer? 

All my best, 
Abinaya
