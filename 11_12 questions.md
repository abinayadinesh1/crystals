how to measure the success of the yields?
how to develop cameras (like uv cameras), to measure how well the plants are growing
	segmentation with uv information for selecting leaves to be pruned (this is smth i could do the literature review on to figure out)
unsolved pruning problem
	2 pass filter: one nn to make a ranking of the leaves that need to be plucked, another nn used to select from that
	binary mask to select the leafs that need to be pruned
what are all the things other than pruning that need to get done?
	optimal lighting conditions
	nutrient conditions
	microbiology, fungal growth, looking at plant disease
	any biochemical/biosignals we can get from the plants to improve yield?
	how can we integrate an automated irrigation system fast with the current system?

come back to sean with real questions and implementations
the robot training problem : acquiring task specific data


to sean:
do you want your final vision to be a production system that feeds people, or a better way to train robots
