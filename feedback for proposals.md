**dichromat designers**

	I love how you took the perspective of wanting to help colorblind artists, and commend the initial research done with the chrome extension and finding colorblind people. I'd be super curious on how the experience creating art differs for regular colorblind people versus colorblind artists, where artists have much more pressure on them to produce work that can be appreciated and sold to a trichromat viewer. I'm not sure how much literature there is on this already, but if there was a way for you to interview artists, I would be extremely curious what the takeaways from those are (there could be something worth publishing into a blog post/transcript here for the class)! In thinking of the word 'harmoniousness' for art, I wonder if theres some sort of chat/visual interface an artist can use to get feedback on the colors of their piece. For example, if they could select a snippet of the screen with their mouse where theres a certain color gradient or blending and the interface would provide some context or feedback on the colors they are using (this could be explored in a purely color geometry sense or a ml/llm sense). In terms of the extension from dichromat art for trichromats to trichromat art for tetrachromats, I'd be curious if you can place a real/simulated color mapping on Jessica's 4D color polytope for trichromats to try to pick colors that would be more rich for a 4D viewer. So excited to see the creative direction, user interviewing, and interface iteration over the next few months!!!
