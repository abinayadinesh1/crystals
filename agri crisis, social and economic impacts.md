bringing agroeco to scale, key drivers and canonical cases

agrocology has gone from one off efforts to scaled ways for many families/communities to process, distribute, and consume agroecologically produced food. 
farmer to farmer movement in central america, the national peasant agroecology movement in cuba, the organic coffee boom in chiapas, and the spread of zero budget natural farming in karnataka. 

Agroecology is very different from conventional agriculture, which means in order to scale it to serve millions of people, it will require a deep understanding in the values of the practices, how to analyze and steward land to grow food while also remediating soil health, and how to distribute food in a way that does not disbalance the means of production. In a conventional system, like industrial agriculture in America, we use technology, new machinery, machine learning and biochemistry to optimize for crop yield while throwing away longevity of the land, quality of produce, preservation of biodiversity and natural resources.

industrial ag leads to resource grabbing by economic elites ? where do we see this?
	white labelling of produce so consumers have no idea where its grown. 
	enabling biopharma companies like syngenta, monsanto, etc etc to produce mass chemicals and dependent seeds that are the only ways to feed people (even though it kills us). 
	monopolization of food system markets by few individuals
Principles in arccordance with the unique reality of every farmer. Ability to maintain and interact with the biodiversity of the landscape through the things you grow and the way you clear the land or bed prep.  

Agroecology aims to reduce
dependence upon external inputs, thereby contributing to the autonomy of
food-producing families and communities. 

There are five canonical examples of the amplification of agroecology around the globe, which enabled more farmers to steward their land autonomously and more families and community members to access locally grown, culturally relevant foods. 

The first case is of the Campesino a Campesino movement in Mesoamerica. Farmers in this movement drew from the ideas of Paulo Friere and traditions of labor sharing with specific practices being of cross visits, demonstration plots, and
small-scale experimentation to teach each other techniques for soil and
water conservation, such as green manure, living and non-living contour
barriers, crop diversification, and intensive bio-horticulture. Extremeley unfortunately, this movement was killed by large estate owners called latifundistas who called in the military to destroy the Kato-Ki cooperative that held together these farmers. Even though they were disbanded in Guatemala, the campesino farmers found work in Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua by partnering with nonprofits and turned the Campesino a Campesino movement in Mesoamerica to a transnational movement called La Via Campesina. 


zero budget natural farming 
farmers do it for the health of their families, food self-sufficiency, and reduced production costs. Most reduced their farm expenses and thus their need for credit, one of the major problems plaguing Indian farmers.
