need a project specific committee:
	send email to arthur guy

writing what are the real qualms we come up against when we want to move from a land based to vertical hydroponics system?
1. losing culture and human connection to foods ? not necessarily true
2. earth, soil, growth --> being replaced for a sterile, optimal environment
	1. actually people would be happier because in these conditions you can grow more okra in places where you normally wouldnt
	2. competing with import costs from international
	3. what are the markets for specialty crops?
	4. what kinds of crops cant grow in a greenhouse?
3. labor - how are we going to train and provide work for all the current laborers
	1. not just americans, but laborers that come in for seasonal work for mexico
4. farmers and laborers dont get to be creative on a monoculture: in a robotic system, the needs arise for people with subject specific information 
	1. even more room for innovation: bringing famers with a lot of crop specific knowledge actually giving farmers more ability to be creative: exactly what nutrients, type of light, seeds, pollination. 

what is my vision for the future?
	what is the prevailing technology?
	what are the ways of living?
	what are the improvements? complete redesigns? insane ability that i want to see in the world:
		the insane ability to buy low cost, high quality, high nutrient foods 

where do i draw inspiration from?

how do we strategically use human in the loop for better training of robots: **bridging farmers to robots so they can focus on their craft** 



make obsidian public and publish writing on agriculture stuff
use personal website for finished thoughts, and obsidian for threads





schedule time to train the robot: get an inuition for why it is jerky and works the way it does
yes!!! i have time with it tomorrow!!!



it is so powerful to know i can do things like:
	set up meetings with authors of papers
	raise enough to hire these authors
	just use open source code and playgrounds to solve extremley hard problems
