heat flow!!
name 3 mechanisms that transport heat

why does jupiter's temperature correlate so well with altitude
bright clouds you see are ammonia clouds

earth - not a gaseous, but solid planet
inner core - solid
liwuid outer core that makes a magnetic field
in the lithosphere, very steep temperature gradient

name the 3 main mechanisms that transport heat!!!! explains all of it
conduction, convection, radiant fields? ??? ? ?

metal feels colder than wood
metal conducts better, so it takes more heat out of ur body

metal good thermal and electroconductors bc of electrons that can carry heat
wood, electrons are locked in place 

conduction  - choice to sit in wooden 


when conduction is inefficient, u force the material to convect. drive convection by sending more heat. 

plate tectonics - plates pushed around and large convection in the mantle because ocean plates subducted. 

cools convectively in the lower mantle. takes millions of years to do so. 
transfers heat from the white-hot core to the brittle lithosphere.Â **The mantle is heated from below, cooled from above, and its overall temperature decreases over long periods of time**


hot material rises fast, can give off little heat in the conductive process. take fluid parcel at below in high parcel and high temp, pressure and temp changing wo giving heat off. decompressing the parcel- idiopathic decompression - entropy does not change

get boundary effect, have to do some conduction

can look through the atmosphere on jupiter, observing photons coming through the layer. heat and other thiings can be carried really differently. photons cant trasnfer eath. 
above 0 altitude, no idiopathic decompression and domination of radiation. 


### diffusion/conduction, convection, and radiation

temperature distribution inside the wall of a house T(x, t=0)
wall of our cabin, understand how heat goes through the walls
heating through convection


wall is a high temperature but still as cold at the outside. 
outside of wall is cold from wind. inside of room is warm from fire. what happens to the temperature of the wall. 

discretize - transferring continuous functions, models, variables, and equations into discrete counterparts

how to solve PDE's like finding the temp dist = discretize the problem
dont solve for temp at every point in space
instead, cut up domain (for us, point in wall) and sample there. 
**give up any attempt to resolve at a greater resolution**

amt of heat that flows is dependent on thermal conductivity
temperature change is diff between how much heat you have and how much heat youre passing on 

temperature chaneg  = difference between 2 heat flows

heat equation


first order deriv - when u have a func and u wanna discretixe it, derivative is approx delta y / delta x
first order = (T(x + delta x) - T(x)) / deltax

second order deriv
take 2 first deriv and diff wrt x one more time. 

if u go from neg first deriv to pos first deriv, its a pos second deriv


Ax^2 --> deriv is 2Ax, which is pos, which is a convex curve (U)
when second deriv is negative, gives off heat

heat equation in 3D where delta is the laplace operator

temperature is not changing and u get stationary distribution
second deriv has to be 0 means its a straight line
