Hi to the team at Orbio!

My name is Abinaya Dinesh and I'm a student from UC Berkeley. I currently research biogeochemical systems at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory while doing a double major in Computer Science and Agriculture. I am really interesting in spectroscopy, remote sensing, and being better able to quantify methane and carbon emissions because of its interconnectedness with agriculture and land practice. My skill sets are full stack but I specialize in in data science and modelling; would love to find a time to chat with the team and think about ways to support Orbio over the summer through an internship or research project. 

All the best, 
Abinaya
