submit eps assignments

N intervals
N+1 points
initialize all arrays in python to N+1

after discretizing its no longer a differential equations
linear system of equations
python package called linear algebra - we will not do it that way!!!

instead, we solve it iteratively
**for high dimensional problems, it is much better to do it iteratively than by a linear system**
	bc gigantic matrices u cant solve
	instead get local solutin every time


1. differential to discretize and get linear system. solve it iteartively
