[Robotic Technologies for High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping: Contemporary Reviews and Future Perspectives](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.611940/full)


need to phenotype plants to select crops for breeding/develop new crop varieties
phenotype = result of gene info and environment
**phenotyping bottleneck** --> led to development of high throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) (using images to phenotype)
	main use case is to identify inter- and intravarietal diversity

[[notes on phenotyping for grapes]]

overview: 
	- how to define drought tolerance from phenotyping
	- stress distance
	- what effects plant phenology (air temperature and soil water ability)
[[notes on current status of high throughput field crop phenotyping]]

questions to ask:
	done anything for looking at stomata behavior? (really important for gas exchange / important to learn about how this changes wrt to global warming)
		influence CO2Â uptake into the leaf
		water loss due to transpiration
		 plant water status 
		leaf temperature
	trying to find whether or not different varieties of grapes has tight stomatal control (isohydric) or less efficient control (anisohydric)
