Week 4

  

1. How would a  desired food system  look in the future?

  

Where will you get your food from? I want to get my food from grocery stores that sell local, seasonal produce. I also want to get it from weekly farmers markets where I have greater variety to choose from and opportunity to talk to the farmers themselves. 

I want it to be produced by farmers in my area, farmers I can visit, talk to and support. farmers who I know as friends or can see as equals. 

It will be produced in a way that is extremeley specific to the environment it grows in and the types of crops being grown. What is the history of the land and how has it been stewarded in the past? What is its current condition, in terms of soil health, water retention, organic matter content, texture, nutrients, slope, and more? What steps need to be taken to improve the health of the land and tend to it while producing crops to feed my community?

  

Who will sell it to me? Not a conglomerate like Whole Foods or Trader Joes where there is no space to speak up about the quality/produce options. These places feel like black boxes where you are at the whim of what is put on the shelves with no say or insight into what gets there, how much of it there is (understanding the supply chain better behind food ). Someone who will listen to the voice of the customer and establish communication between the people producing food and the people buying it. 

  

How will I acquire it? I want to acquire it individually: it is infeasible in our current societies to ask everyone to arrange one time and place to all get groceries with others in my vicinity, nor would it be super productive (other than in bringing consumers physically closer to farmers/produce). So, need a physical storefront where food can be shelved/stored for a nonzero amt of time. Could also have fruit stands/markets like they do in Costa Rica. 

  

What would buying in a group look like? 

Most people live in residential areas/apartments/buildings where there is some sort of landlord or homeowners association connecting them. A possible idea is vegetable sharing to reduce food waste. 'What's in your fridge?' For every fruit/vegetable you share, you get a food stamp/ticket/coupon to use at a local farmers market or grocery store. Could be done under EBT/farm bill or local govs. 

  
  

1. Can you point  to structural obstacles to transformation ( to achieved your desired food system) that are ingrained in capitalist institutions and values.

Everybody has a different house, different schedule, different standards of quality, different levels of care about where the food they eat comes from, even culturally different foods they eat, different expectations for what kinds of foods they can get where and when, etc. In a capitalist society, individuals earn to increase their freedom and independent access to whatever it is they want; everybody is used to having extremeley high (sometimes unrealistic) degrees of optionality and at extremeley low costs. When everybody wants different things, it makes it really hard to decide what to fund/where to put energy/resources.

  

Fundamentally and historically, capitalism means the exploitation of labor, cutting production costs, and increasing production/profitability. This is not at all the methods with which we want to increase productive power, and has shown to be unsustainable (look at how expensive fertilizer is and how dependent farmers are on synthetic inputs now; how difficult it is to grow).

  

The first structural obstacle is lack of farmer-to-farmer connections and participatory action. Knowledge based land care and agroecological practices can't scale without the knowledge from land stewards and native peoples who can teach and share these practices. 

  

The second structural obstacle, is the dispossession and land insecurity of farmers. 100 years ago, in pre capitalistic peasant farming, peasants owned or rented their land and could decide what, when and where to grow their crops. After the development of class differentiation among peasants and land grabs by various States (mainly in Western Europe and North America), there became a segregation of powers between laborers, capitalistic farmer land tenants, and landowners. The people working the lands have no choice in how the land is tended to, rendering them incapable of improving the system even though they have the most knowledge of doing so. 

  

1. How to achieve your envisioned food system by deliberately addressing obstacles that growth-based industrial societies pose to radical social transformation. Actions to overcome barriers?

To achieve my envisioned food system, we need radical social transformation among farmers, redistribution of produce from conglomerates to coops, and transparent food systems that increase consumer knowledge of how farming works. We need more community action on both ends of the spectrum: if consumers can 'buy as communities' (being members at the same coop, sharing surplus groceries to prevent food waste) and farmers can share land ownership and farming knowledge (having common forest spaces to increase landscape diversity and regular meetups to share practices and outcomes), we would bridge the extremely disjoint food system we have now. Dependent on the needs of the community, specifics can change: if a weekly farmers market doesnt make sense for the climate, size of the location, or methods of transportation, systems can be designed around the very specific needs of the people.**
