[[Agroecology and the agrarian question in the twenty first century copia.pdf]]
key points: the solution is not to dissolve small farms, but to transform capitalist agriculture into agroecological agriculture

theres a heated debate between people who study the socioeconomic class analysis of marxist political economy and the left wing agrarian movements and their fight for food sovereignty. Marx might have more to say on the agrarian question that differs from his thoughts on socioeconomic class. 


what did marx think about our economy? books on marx
paul atkins for robotics

agroecology - apply knowledge of ecology to the design and management of land and a food system. 
	**understand that all land has specific geology, biology, climate and history that effects the way you grow food. this should be obvious.** 
		farming can get EASIER if you understand these things. let nature do a bunch of the work for you (microbes to decompose organic matter, intercropping to provide shade for plants to grow, and hedgerows to reduce pests) instead of apply chemicals to EVERYTHING hoping to patch up absolute failures in your land stewardship. 
	the political aspect is that farming should be **locally oriented** and **democratized** - where power is distributed equitably among producers and eaters. 
		bring power back to the farmer and to the consumer: dont make food an issue of class or economic status. we all have a right to healthy, high quality food. 

capitalism breaks at the level of our basic human needs: like healthcare, access to food, shelter. these edges, where upper class people and politicians must confront the contrast is where things break. 
	healthcare - free in canada, not in america. which is doing better?
	shelter - new york offering homes to all immigrants/homeless people (now theres a huge immigrant crisis and people are mad their tax dollars are going to housing them). **do we abandon them? or is access to a baseline level of shelter a human right that our government should uphold?** 
	access to food - what is the right baseline quality of food that the government should ensure people should have access to?!! 

how is costa rica a good case examples for anticapitalist agriculture?
our established quality of food everyone should have access to is extremely low. their baseline quality of food is very high but they are also much less capitalistic. they care about **pura vida**. dont care about wealth in liquid cash but in health and happiness.

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">capitalism flourishes at the levels of dispensable income and luxury, but breaks at the level of basic human needs. </mark>


apparently it takes a social transformation to enable agroecology to thrive. can we think about why?
	1. how would a farmer suddenly change from conventional to agroecological? the minimum thing they need is knowledge about the ecology of their land, which they'd get from research and studies, but mainly oral tradition and knowledge sharing with other farmers and natives. 
	2. 


marxist ppl think farmer agency is populist bc it ignores government structures. 

the agrarian question - how do our theories on labor and economy scale from cities to countryside? 
why small farming would fail in the marxist view is because its a form of productive organization that is not capable of developing the forces of production. 
	arguably, neither is contemporary extractivist capitalist agriculture !
	WHY SMALL FARMING ACTUALLY DEVELOPS THE FORCES OF PRODUCTION: its is a **knowledge-intensive** form of production that **maximizes the productivity of energy returns relative to energy investment** and that this constitutes the development of the productive forces.
		get more energy out for energy in !!!!!!!!! bc nature puts in some of the work for u!!!!!!!!! highkey
		

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> An alignment between agrarian political economy and agroecologists, or between scholars and activists, or between theoreticians and practitioners, is a precondition of building the political alliances and social movements capable of creating unity out of diversity. </mark>


## the agrarian question
Marx!!! was interested by how capitalism transforms agricultural practices and if ag can transform/be a productive force for capitalism. 
the author chooses to define peasant farmers, historically, as people who used their own labor and small owned/borrowed parcels of land to grow food. they didn't do much to stimulate the economy and didnt have much power of the terms and conditions of their employment. 

Marx tried to find 3 ways of transitioning from pre capitalist peasant farming (<3) to small scale petty commodity peasant farming. 
1. primitive accumulation in England, where feudal landlords dispossessed peasant farmers from their land (supported by the state) to turn rich peasants into a propertyless class of waged laborers. new social structure = landlords --> capitalist tenant farmers --> rural waged laborers (previously rich peasants). marks said this would happen widespread in western europe, but other countries would have different transitions. 
2. peasant class differentiation --> where better-off peasants who pay rent exploit wage laborers. instead of people working for themselves, we have made room for the capitalist farmer who, by nature, has the below values
	**1. core features of capitalism are: exploiting labor, improving productivity, and cutting costs of production**
3. HE DEVELOPED A THIRD PATH VERY LATE IN HIS LIFE. the peasant community will collectively transform into an <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">element of collective production on a national scale. </mark> this requires:
	1. land to be held in common
	2. community members to have access to land necessary to produce their own food
	3. membership in community is not just based on family
		<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">	4. collectivism has to override private property</mark> (this might be where things get tricky)
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">				common lands such as pasture and forest sitting beside individual peasant plots</mark>
		PLEASEEEE YESYESYESYEYSYEYSYEYSYSYEY!!!!!!
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">		 combined the **progressive features of capitalism** with a set of features derived from **historically adaptable peasant social relations**</mark>
<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"><mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">		capitalist production without the capitalist regime?! making more food and making more money without exploiting labor and cutting costs in a way that harms the system</mark></mark>
	this makes me want to cry
"smallholding and petty landowernship production proceeds without being governed by the general rate of profit" --> this is the power of social networks and collectivism. there is a bridging concept that is greater than liquid wealth, that is the health of the community first. 
	

personal note: why did we need to go from pre capitalist peasant farming to small scale petty commodity peasant farming ??? :(((( )))) who tf came up with and suffocated everyone and everything with capitalism? why is it so large scale? when do we draw the line between opportunity for greater things with equity for a minimum standard of well being. 




skipping from 691 to 701 (even tho this section looks really good)

### agroecology
interesting points:
 1. "Production processes in agroecological systems are meant to be labour- intensive and, for the most part, small-scale, although some mechanization might occur."
	 1. does this need to be the case? how can we make the life of a small farmer a bit easier in the sense of manual labor? 
 2. farm input and output choices are heterogeneous and are based, as they were for all but the last century or so, on local preferences and markets, including cultural and social norms, and not on the needs of distant external markets
<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;"> 3. An alternative way of framing agroecological science and practice, in terms used in Section 4, is that agroecology is in part a farm management system predicated upon closing the linearities of capitalist agricultural techniques and reconstituting closed loop cycles within diverse multi-nodal webs of life as a means of sustaining and indeed enhancing soil fertility. As such, it reduces reliance on energy and energy-carrying material inflows across time and space while maintaining contemporary energy density and high returns on contemporary energy expenditures</mark> - i just think they ate. 

need to define:
- marxist
- populist
- productive organization
- forces of production (by the marxist viewpoint)
- what is a post capitalist future?



extremeley big problem is lack of participatory or farmer to farmer led learning and research!!!!!!! literally the main blocker to the transformative social justice at the roots of agroecology. LETS FREAKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. 
other extremeley big problem is lack of labor and that small, agroecological systems are apparently meant to be labor intensive. i think we can do better.
