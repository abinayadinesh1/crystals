Week 3


Agroecology has gone from one-off efforts to produce food in an ecologically positive way to scaled ways for many families/communities to process, distribute, and consume high quality produce that also remediates the land it was grown in. The main drivers in scaling this concept were the farmer to farmer movement in Central America, the national peasant agroecology movement in Cuba, the organic coffee boom in Chiapas, and the spread of Zero Budget Natural farming in Karnataka. 

  

In a conventional system, like industrial agriculture in America, we use technology, new machinery, machine learning and biochemistry to optimize for crop yield while throwing away longevity of the land, quality of produce, preservation of biodiversity and natural resources. In order to scale agroecology to serve millions of people, it will require a deep understanding in the values of the practices, how to analyze and steward land to grow food while also remediating soil health, and how to distribute food in a way that does not disbalance the means of production. 

  

It has been known that industrial agriculture leads to resource grabbing by economic elites and misinformation of the consumer- this can be seen white labeling of produce so consumers have no idea where it's grown, biopharma companies like syngenta, monsanto,that can produce mass chemicals and dependent seeds that are the only ways to feed people, and the monopolization of food system markets by few individuals. On the other hand, the main efforts of agroeco are to increase the power and control of farmers over their own production and to broaden access to food grown in healthy, environmentally friendly ways. Their principles are in accordance with the unique reality of every farmer and their values are to maintain and interact with the biodiversity of the landscape through the things farmers are growing and stewarding the land. 

  

They aim to reduce dependence upon external inputs, thereby contributing to the autonomy of food-producing families and communities. 

  

There are five canonical examples of the amplification of agroecology around the globe, which enabled more farmers to steward their land autonomously and more families and community members to access locally grown, culturally relevant foods. We can use the case of the Campesino a Campesino movement in Mesoamerica as one example. Farmers in this movement drew from the ideas of Paulo Friere and traditions of labor sharing with specific practices being of cross visits, demonstration plots, and small-scale experimentation to teach each other techniques for soil and water conservation, such as green manure, living and non-living contour

barriers, crop diversification, and intensive bio-horticulture. Extremely unfortunately, this movement was killed by large estate owners called latifundistas who called in the military to destroy the Kato-Ki cooperative that held together these farmers. Even though they were disbanded in Guatemala, the campesino farmers found work in Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua by partnering with nonprofits and turned the Campesino a Campesino movement in Mesoamerica to a transnational movement called La Via Campesina.
