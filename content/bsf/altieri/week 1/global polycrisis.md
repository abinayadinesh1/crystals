issues in the atmosphere: acid rain, pollution, ozone depletion (meaning more UV reaching the ground)
issues in water: we used too much of it. we also polluted the remaining. 
issues in oceans: coastal regions that fish a lot are getting destroyed. we are running out of fish. rivers are contaminated with industrial, municipal, agricultural, and livestock waste
soil: loss of productivity, land abandonment, 

	per capita food production in many parts of the world is decreasing.

## What Every Environmentalist Needs to Know About Capitalism
https://monthlyreview.org/2010/03/01/what-every-environmentalist-needs-to-know-about-capitalism/

world climate agreement in copenhagen in 2009 
**stripped out specific reduction targets from the final text and ensured it was not legally binding**
so lowk failed because no incentives for gov to keep up w what they said


the main drivers behind current environmental damage are our increasing populations, the use of technology to accelerate construction and development, and an economy/government that boundlessly pursues economic growth in lieu of systemic improvements. 


**greed, exploitation of laborers, and competition** (among people, businesses, countries) are not only acceptable but are actually good for society because they help to make our economy function “efficiently.”

1. capitalism can always expand to increase one's individual growth and has no boundaries with nature. exploitation for indiviiual success leading to failure of the group. 
2. There is no alternative under capitalism to the endless expansion of the “**real economy**” (i.e., production), irrespective of actual human needs, consumption, or the environment

the stationary state of a system, where money produced is just reinvested in the system to keep things running. net neutral.
