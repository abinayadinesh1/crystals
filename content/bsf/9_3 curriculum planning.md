  

decolonization as being new human 

new human - death of the old human

ohonon 

how do we be disciplined about grief

  

something being very cerebral and thinking about it in a personal level

access to the sacred

  

working with and uplifting sacred and ancestral knowledge and wisdom

what are the conditions of holding that practice and holding that knowledge? so approriation and misuse doesn’t happen. or else, its just self indulgent. 

  

what are some of the practices that ground this organization, the land, the practices we believe in. 

being a container for more personal self reflection

  

flow naturally and make sense, theyll want to read the readings if we do a good job of explaining. 

  

being able to specifically cite things we are referring to. incorporating a few lines of a text in our lectures. 

  

remebering something because she wrote it down in her paper. 

  

understand whats been taken from you and weep for it. presence the grief before we talk about the future and what is idealic. 

  

grounding in an embodied practice

be present with that kind of power - take what you need and know that it will change you as you change the land. 

  

blurring the lines as much as possible between us and the environemnt. how can i get closer to what i am working with? 

  

i have you but you have me. i have the land but the land has me. 

  

plant stain my hands and the dirt under my hands. at the pores of the plantation. forced relationship and forced intimacy. 

  

  

speaking of authors as a close friend, deep understanding 

  

black and blur 

good woman
