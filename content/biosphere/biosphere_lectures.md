- how do we **measure** evaporation off something?
- water stress: too much water **AND** not enough water
- agriculture **storing water from one season to the next**
	- **water and water policy**
- higher CO2, stomata will close and we might save water from evapotranspiration
	- high concentrations inside the leaf
- why is water important?
	- strong solvent, necessary to transport nutrients and MOVE THINGS
	- force for growth: provides turgidity for cell growth and expansion
	- electrons for photosynthesis
	- weathering and soil formation
	- regulating climate
	- boiling point is lower at sea level because more pressure in the atmosphere
- amt of work that can be done by evaporating a gram of water?
	- Joule - newtonmeter
	- energy does work, which is force * distance
- water moves downhill ENERGETICALLY
	- osmotic potential, gravity, potential
	- Fwater = soil, plant, atmosphere continuum

	- stem, xylum where water can move to leaves where water can 
	- flux of water is driven by ohm's law, current flowing through wires is given by the sum of potential differences (voltage differences) divided by the sum of resistances

	 voltage = current * resistance
	- adhesion and cohesion
	- water potential - how much pressure does it take to get the liquid out of a leaf (sap), how much turgor pressure is in the leaf?
- cooler when u pass by a field of grass or alfalfa field because stomata are closed at night, more water in the leaf, 
humidity leading to more rainfall because the atmosphere can hold more water
	saturation vapor pressure
		**Relative humidity is also approximately the ratio of the actual to the saturation vapor pressure**.
	from dew point, can measure saturation vapor pressure

what effects evaporation from one area to another?
measuring evaporation:
	pan
	eddy covariance for measuring fluxes
	sap flow
	lysimeter
sun coming in, how much is reflected from albido, how much is absorbed (by leaf area index)

evaporation rates are either energy limited or water limited




# water part 2
we have to build around 30% year to year variability in precipitation

dams for flood protection and water storage
storms are going to be warmer, and we cant use mountains as a reservoir anymore because it will just melt too fast


green water - water that goes through plants\
	roots that reach groundwate is how endemic species survive in semiarid conditions
blue water - 
north sierras -> sacramento delta --> bay

really hard to map evaporation!
warmer world, more evaporation? not seen in california
salts in root zone arent getting washed out (more evaporation than precipitation)
GRACE satellite - how is the gravitational attraction of satellites is driven by amount of groundwater on earth?

central valley in california and texas panhandle use the same amount of water, but they grow very diff crops (speciality vs cash). we need to get more specific if we want to use less water for agriculture (specific species, changing the diets of consumers).

OUR WATER GETS MISUSED BECAUSE IT IS HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED
	https://www.ewg.org/research/california-water-subsidies
	EWG found that water subsidies in the CVP are overwhelmingly controlled by the largest farms. In 2002, the largest 10 percent of the farms got 67 percent of the water, for an average subsidy worth up to $349,000 each at market rates for replacement water. Twenty-seven large farms received subsidies each worth $1 million or more at market rates, compared to a median subsidy for all recipients of $7,076. One farm — Woolf Enterprises of Huron, Fresno County — received more water by itself than 70 CVP water user districts, for a subsidy worth up to $4.2 million at market rates.
In 2002, the average price for irrigation water from the CVP was less than 2 percent what Los Angeles residents pay for drinking water, one-tenth the estimated cost of replacement water supplies, and about one-eighth what the public pays to buy its own water back to restore the San Francisco Bay and Delta

went from 400,000 acres to 1.4 million acres and most of that land is bought by big industrial farms, hedge funds, big bankers. one almond takes 1.3 gallons to produce.

questions:
what was the name of the equipment you said is cheap and useful for measuring the water pressure of  a plant?
long dry areas with no water mean we dont attract a lot of pest or disease, then wouldn't farms, where there is a lot of water being distributed consistenly, be a hotspot for pests?
how does israel share their water across stakeholders?
	they get their water from palestinian people
	at least they dont waste it

	metabolism - how do we get energy
	reproduction 
	internal regulation in response to the environment

Sound energy occurs when an object vibrates. Noise, whether within the human range of hearing or not, is sound energy.

# energy and material fluxes in the biosphere
Planck’s Law fluction of wavelenght of light and tempearteue of the surface = how much energy comes from a given light wave
light with short wavelenghts and high frequency have more energy
