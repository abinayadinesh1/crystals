macronutrients
	important in large quantities: like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
micro
	important in smaller quantities: zinc, iron, magnesium, calcium

for plants, these come through the soil and are absorbed by the roots

endomycorrhizal - inside the root
ecto - outside the root
exchange sugar for water and nutrients . **they generate enzymes that allow plants to do nutrient uptake**
have hyphae that allow them to get inside cells and around cells ? 
plants w associations w these 

pools - where something is stored
flux - movement from one pool to another

atmosphere composition
	78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 2water, ,< 1 all other
	greenhouse gases: gases that trap heat

CO2
very very long half life in the atmosphere
CH4
from microbial and anthropogenic sources
microbes produce this under anoxic conditions
shorter lifespan (12 years in the atmosphere)
N20
lasts > 100 years in the atmosphere
40% due to humans, but 60% from wetlands, agriculture, livestock, and burning fossil fuels

carbon cycle
main sink is through plants (photosynthesis)
plants take up c from co2 - is is not respired, but assimilated. 
gross primary productivity: all biomass formed from co2 taken up by photosynthesis
	how much co2 being taking in is actually used for something constructively
diff algea and **cyanobacteria**: tiny unicellular organisms release a lot of O2

how can environmental conditions influence part of the c cycle?
