need to go over parts 1 and 2
emthane camp and a carbon dioxide camp - methane gets converted to CO2 in the atmosphere which has a longer half life
multiple sources of methane - wetlands, rice production, livestock, melting permafrost, fracking, atmospheric chemistry
doudna + banfield looking at ways to use crispr to reduce methane production in rice paddies

spectroscopy - wavelength of energy getting emitted/absorbed


archaea - earliest life form
microbes help cow break down straw and hay, producing methane
termites produce methane - archaea in their belly to digest 
alternate wetting and drying to reduce the water level of rice for a period (and methanogenesis) without sacrificing rice yield

during the day, warmer boundary layer rose and incorporates stuff from up above so even if more methane is being produced, it looks like theres less. 

measurements 
production
destruction 
transformation

early years, more labile carbon. over 5000 days, mayberry wetland restoration leads methane flux production to go from 600 to 100. 

susanna trinjee, joint genome institute. 
have drawdown during the summer because of OH. 
CO2 flying carpet, methane flying carpet. 

routes for methane production/transport in a wetland
	cant measure tiny fluxes with eddy covariance technique
	whendee silver puts changes on the soil 
root exudates stimulate anaerobes to break down hard to do OM
after herbicide, drop in photosynthesis (who were exuding carbs) and drop in methane
	proves coupling of soil w methanogenesis
his methods let u measure photosynthesis and methane production simultaneously (instead of the chamber methods)


wetland plants need huge pores in their xylum to respire. big channeling of oxygen through the xylum allows 
	**need new sensors/sensing to improve our ability to look at microsites in the soil**, how much 
		could study diffusion of methane through a water column


ACE dutch slough
	trying to disentagle bi
	water table gets warmer, more enzymatic reactions going on 
	tidal system gets aerated, produce less methane
	methane flux inc w inc photosynthesis

carbon dioxide + hydrogen gas = methane
estuary, salt water has sulfate, little methane being produced bc diff bacteria are overpowering the archaea
	depletion of oxygen, nitrate and sulfate are what promote methanogenesis
