plant functional traits
	evolutionary traits, centered about maximizing return. MAX SUGAR, LEAST NUTRIENTS. 
	different traits arise from different limitations of different climates
LEAF AREA INDEX - total leaf area / ground area
	measure of ecosystem productivity, capacity for carbon storage, energy exchange
	higher is associated with higher canopy density

assimilation or longevity? 
photosynthetic capacity - carbon gaining potential per unit leaf biomass - max rate at which plant can photosynthesize 
angiosperms - flowering
	seed is produced by a flowering plant, seed enclosed in an overy
gymnosperms - pinecone
	seed is produced by non flowering plant and its enclosed!
	conifer
deciduous - shed leaves yearly


why diff plants have diff rooting structures?
	terrain, water availability, nutrient, windiness, slope, nutrient availability
	if annual - produces seeds and dies w short lifespan, then dont invest in root system
	oxygen diffusion, root hairs that increase surface area for nutrient uptake
	nutrient storage - like a carrot or potato

david attenborough - life cycle of desert plants
their adaptations:
leaf makes them loose lots of heat and energy! ? why desert plants dont have leaves. 
sphere - minimum surface area for given volume

rain causing plants to ramp up their metabolism
rain and color

**photosynthesis**
calvin cycle - berkeley dude
light dependent reactions and dark reactions (calvin cycle)
	light is absorbed by a membrane of the chloroplast
convert light energy to chemical energy
dark reactions in the stroma of the chloroplast



photosynthesis - plants put co2 in 3 carbon compound (c3)
co2 and oxygen come in through stomata, rubisco breaks c02


c3 plant
c4 plant
	corn
	grasses
	more efficient under higher temperatures
