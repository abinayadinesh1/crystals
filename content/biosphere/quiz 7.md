Give an overall description of the Soil-Plant-Water Continuum


What are the 3 specific processes/resistors that are involved in the process or drive the continuum.

What is the Global Water Balance, and why is it important?

If large scale water balances (like the Global Water Balance) become more limiting, how can we expect plant water uptake to change?
