atmosphere
O2 and VOC'S
convection!!! 
	areas in the air w higher temperature (rises) and lower temperature (falls)
	
why does energy move at such a huge scale?
orographic effect = rain shadow


O2
a lot of early oxygen was in the water
iron settled when there was little oxygen
then the oxygen caused it to oxidize to rust (which is Fe3, insoluble so precipitates)
the rust caused a lack of iron which allowed iron to build up again

cyanobacteria - photosynthesis releases a lot of oxygen


volatile organic compounds
many are manmade, precursor to smog, comes from car pollutants, aerosols from plants
