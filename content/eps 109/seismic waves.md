standing waves have two polarizations (vertical and horizontal)
pressure waves? are really weird and kinda noisy

gutenberg richter law - how many of a certain magnitude earthquake there is. higher magnitude, less amount (N)![[Screenshot 2023-10-24 at 5.20.26 PM.png]]

how much energy is released by a specific earthquake
take the magnitude and find the moment
the most energy released is by the most powerful earthquakes: 30 times more

10^1.5(a-bM)
a magnitude 5 earthquak


2008 financial crisis - bc of predatory lending 
	iceland's punishment: 36 bankers, 96 years in jail
	america did not give ppl jail time

small earthquakes cant lead to anything - FALSE
foreshock and aftershock probabiliies: useful if u have a global earthquake catalog
	really hard to do it locally because we dont have enough data

fracking - sites where they were injecting water in the ground to extract oil from places it would've been impossible to otherwise. 


# intro to ordinary differential equations
keplers law of planetary motion (2nd) - conservation of angular momentum
newton explained all of kepler's laws by F=ma if he assumed 
newton's universal law of gravity
