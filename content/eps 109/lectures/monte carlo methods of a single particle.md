call it monte carlo if u employ random numbers
dont care about the specifics of every move but the average/collective result over thousands of moves


### example 1
radation in the atmosphere
infrared photons absorbed as they try to get through a thicker and thicker atmosphere
	every time a photom interactions with a molecule, it transfers some of its momentum and increases its thermal energy
	this doesnt change the temperature of our atmosphere, but we do
20% of incoming radiation gets directly reflected by clouds
17% gets absorbed by a molecule (full transfer of momentum and now molecule 'gone' from the atmosphere)
4% reflected at lower levels
50% absorbed by the groun, which gets heated again and reimits photons
earth gives off as much energy as it recieves, and warming is driven by 
big volcanic eruption puts dust really high and leads to a slight cooling effect (tiny ice age)
	reemmited photons get absorbed more often 
our clouds are made of water, but jupiter has methane clouds

### example 2
simulate radiation transport in tumor treatment
chemotherapy
tumor looks similar to healthy tissue, radiation just destroys all cell tissue

### example 3
simulating density of our atmosphere
temperature decreases
mass of molecules, gravity, temperature
boltzman factor converts kelvin to energy
energy = elevation * mass * g
propose a new location
	if the new energy is lower, always accept
	if the energy is lower, accept with some probability (given by acceptance probability) ()
