### history of computation
first time it was used was for crack german enigma machine: alan turing's code breaking machine (then we got radar could detect u-boats). 

slide rule: 
	can use it to multiple and divide (take a and b, then log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b)). do log(a) + log(b) then find what log(x) gets you that value?
punch cards: 
	1 line is one line of code
	characters go from 0 to 72
programmable pocket calculator
	can start w a number, press record. 
	next time you put a number in, will perform the same steps. 
asics to write real code with all 

(in east germany, didnt have tech of the west because of the cold war). very hard to go from east to west (didnt want them to leave). built a wall. loophole: his grandmother would leave after 60 (because government didnt need to pay her pension). 

cray-1 computer system:
	huge (size of a room). computational power of a phone. 
home computer from commador:
	special: had floppy discs. 
	WOW. in past, once you switch off the computer, all memory is gone. had to store everything on tapes.
	floppy disc was wayyy better. 
maniac mansion computer games! **graphics these days are so much better but ideas are not.**

moore's law: the number of transistors on a microchip **doubles every year**, but the **cost halves**. 
people now are more worried abt energy consumption? on a device, necessary to produce ur device...
processors have reached their power limit bc we cant dissipate more than what we're currenlty putting out. 
**Power consumed by semiconductors creates heat, which must be removed from the device, but how to do this efficiently is a growing challenge.
we have to reduce the power we;re using or improve performance for the same amount of power.**
	what are the implications of processors reaching their power limit?![[Screenshot 2023-09-09 at 6.01.21 PM.png]]
cache - intermediate memory

measurements 
	whenever u take measurement, u have measurement uncertainty. 
	CERN - european organization for nuclear research. 
		has a tunnel beneath switzerland. 
			generate a magnetic field that can accelerate particles in the channel almost to the speed of light and then collide them! in collisions, they look for new particles they cant see. 
	accuracy - a systematic deviation inherent to a device or method. big accuracy from the target. 
	precision - statistical fluctuation due to random interferences. no constant offset, but not all perfectly equal measurements. random deviation.

using a really really strong telescope to find exoplanets. planets themselves are too small and too far away. but, we can see stars. and we can measure the light coming from stars. if there is a periodic frequency shift in the light being emitted, we can theorize that there must be some orbiting planet around this sun blocking the light at some points in time. 
	whats the probability the planet is real?
