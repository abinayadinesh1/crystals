### heat eq in 2d
symmetric derivative - value at one step to the left minus value at one step to the right / 2x
tridiagonal matrix! system of linear equations made by time steps of our discretization of the heat eq? 
N intervals, N + 1 points

### 4 methods to derive stationary state



122 37
we reached a boundary, our point was at:  (122, 38)  and it was going to  (122, 39, 1.0) 

boundary is at y =39, we were at 38 so we stopped and made a new particle

y was at 1, we didnt want it to go to 0 so we stopped
(120, 1)
(120, 0, 1.0)


normal = gradient vector
