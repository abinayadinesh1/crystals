	approach relative to the state of the art

authoritative view on the state of the art (this could be a combination of research papers, products in market, blogs, etc),
what your project contributions will be and why they will matter


the current setup we have is using stereo pi ()
some issues we've run into so far are
	stereo pi incompaitbility with raspberry pi module 3 cameras
	flares that occur because the filter is too far away from 
rgb one side, either ir or uv 
is there a light seal? 3d print a light seal 
	light control important to figure out
make a camera that shoots 2 pictures and align them
bit of cv used to align the two images - comp imaging piece to merge two images. do we want to remove the parallax
