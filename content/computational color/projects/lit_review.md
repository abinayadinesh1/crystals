present an update on your pitch that contextualizes your goals and/or approach relative to the state of the art
read as widely and deeply as you can to develop an authoritative view on the state of the art (this could be a combination of research papers, products in market, blogs, etc), and work to distill that view into something that you can teach the rest of the class succinctly in a mini-lecture. This will be most successful if you focus it as an argument about what your project contributions will be and why they will matter, relative to what already exists in the world. It is completely appropriate -- actually necessary! -- that you continue to evolve your pitch, and project plans, relative to what you are learning through this reading. Acknowledging these changes would be natural and positive in the global conversation of class about our collection of projects
