**ao - deformable mirror to counteract chromatic aberrations**

  

**dichromat designers**

dichromats serving a trichromat audience? 

what theyve already done: chrome extension, get some observations

find colorblind people - alr have 5

  

helping people make art!!! 

dichromats make art for tetrachromats 

trichromats make art for tetrachromats

  

literatire review on the epxeriences of artists/designers

recruiting subjects

contextutakl inquiries and interview

  

loved how you want to interview ppl /collect real user experience

how much do dichromats alr have an idea whats going on

harmoniousness !

  

  

**color modeling and printing**

making color tests for finding tetrachromats int ehw ild

model—>print the ink in a certain way 

have the inks, have the 

  

reflectance spectrums of paints after you mix them together. 

non reumannian geometry - small differences dont add up to large 

examine a computational justification for the cie lab color space

  

**retinal sampling**

why our cones sampled so randomly?

what methods were used to get our cone mosaic?

**eccentricity we are modelling at. cones are drastically going to differ in the fovea vs periphery.** 

eye motion mitigates need for optimal arrangement unless u have a distribution of L2. 

what are the cone mosaics of other species?

how did we acquire data of what our cone mosaic looks like?

  

**foursight**

weak tetrachromat vs strong tetrachromat

what is the long term impact of enchroma glasses? what happens after you take the enchroma glasses off?

how do u design a notch filter

  

**epsilon**

graphics simulator for multispectral images?

minimal model for emergence of high dim color vision

making a graphics simulator to make a large number of simulators in a short amt of time - mitsuba

  

**nature vision**

NDVI

subtract near infrared from green light

vegetation is really active in near infrared

multispectral vision for fire prevention

moisture content in vegetation using a multispectral camera

absorbance spectrum of ‘wet leaves’ vs ‘dry leaves’

internal water vs external

picking IR vs UV

capturing images from high altitude: ur system must be compact

segmentation task of vegetation vs non, wet vs dry. **show a multispectral dataset is better than rgb**

satellites have near infrared and visible spectral capture ability. atmosphere only has a few windows in spectral distribution. 

COOPERATIVE MULTISPECTRAL FROM SATELLITES W UV FROM GROUND

using satellite capabilities to support us

if tetrachromats see in uv/ir instead?
