want to bridge more of my own interests with the project direction
current to dos:
	is there anything interesting in brian wandell's book that is able to bridge the compneuro model and our dataset to how color dimensionality emerges in a biological organism
	is this actually tetrachromatic? 
	better alignment script
	get everything down for 2 spectral ranges and then add 3rd as cherry on top 
	email atsu for preprint on how model works
	go back to lecture slides and go back to project stuff looking for inspiration on what we can do 


is this really tetrachromatic or not?
cmf is very specific and mathematical - how else can we model color dimensionality?

how does color dimensionality emerge in humans?
1. light from some source (the sun, a lightbulb) reflects off a material
2. a spectrum of light bounces off that material and can reach our face
3. our lense focuses some of that light to the back of our eye, the retina, where a bunch of different specialized cells take in the light and convert that into a signal 
our 3 cone cells take wavelengths of light and process them separately depending on the type of pigment in the cell


can we simulate chromatic aberration?
