  
**comments on our presentation**
need to practice presentations beforehand
need to time beforehand
normalize exposure between rgb and ir
fix alignment 
try pca onto diff color spaces
i shouldve taken 5 seconds to go over nerfs and the slides i did there 
choosing papers that we actually want to implement or that are literally exactly what we need. narrowing/being more focused
calibration matrix

  

**four sight**
spectral power distribution of a display, get original rgv values
can get a lot more rgb impafes by taking images from display
using broadband surfaces - munsell surfaces. 
pick an illuminance
get the reflectance
pca -
covariance along principal axis
  
  
**office hours w ren this week** 
talk abt life - sad i wasnt able to do as much as i wanted for this class/saw it going in a diff direction take the things i like the most and NOT take a class on it? kill the passion/interest?
go over the slides i didnt get to present. nerfs, his background w them, most recent work, should we do this too? 

  

need to catch up with atsu on the state of the camera, lenses, make better alignment
