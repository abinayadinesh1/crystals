team literature review presentations
**dichromat designers**
convert color to cielab, so u can get the position of the color in the space

person has an understandung of images and what color is present in the image
can we fine tune a clip model to understand how the person sees
then can we use that to educate them on what the colors really are? help them see differences where they wouldnt usually? 

**retinal sampling team**
looking at the patterns on the 
s cone has very crystalline sampling
lot of variability between l:m ratios
l and m cells might not be randomly placed, but clumped



define an optimal set of cone mosaics via statistical analysis and a backpropogation schema
learn the cone mosaic as we learn human vision
start with a model of cone mosaic at infancy
find optimal distribution.mosaicing of cones
ratio of L->M. S stays constant based on L and M

random draw from distribution 
classifying cone subtypes via adaptive optics line scan OCT

## **eye neuroanatomy**
the first steps in seeing  - extremeley good recommendation 
### eye optics
cornea
lens
	does some focusing
axons of retinal ganglion cell burst out back of retina into the optic nerve
	no place for photorecptors there, makes a blind spot
dark in the eye
in the eye, get fundus view
gullstrand all spherical model
	"what is the index of refraction of this here?"
	what is the radius of curvature of the outside of the cornea
**3d world, simulate actual retinal signals as the eye !!
	nerf 3d world --> see how brain would recieve signal
	polans paper who did it**
ray trace to calculate the transfer of light through an optical system
computer graphics people said instead of getting a psf better, why dont we just render the picture we wouldve gotten if we render that image in the world

gullstrand model or polands model, can use ray tracing to generate 3d images of the world

**michael land - the optical structure of animal eyes**
<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">	recc - animal eyes</mark>

humans do lens based image formation. rays of light get refracted and bent very ferociously . 
lens' index of refraction must be higher than that of air
**erased the curved interface between your eye and the air.**

fish has a spherical lense
	has gradient index of refraction of the lens. higher protein in the middle that 
	do cone cells change the refraction at all?
lobster eyes are how we make x ray telescopes




photoreceptor
image sensors, lot of wiring on it.

electro micrograph

horizontal cells- **lateral inhibition**, puts image into the gradient domain. bipolar cells are a relay system to get info to the RGC's. 
each cone cells connects to two bipolars and two retinal ganglions
	on/off 
convolution in lateral inhibition 
1 to 2 cone to rgc IN THE FOVEA
in the periphery, huge pooling. 
	more aggrgation  in the periphery. 


**averted gaze viewing**
cone cells in the fovea are smalle rthan outside

no s cone cells in the fovea
curernt model doesnt understand color emergence in the periphery
foveal tritanopia - can show people are blue colorblind right in their fovea

s cones are different from ml cones
they really dont like being clumped together

simulating photoreceptor mosaic (iset bio)
CMOS sensor


myopia - eyeball stretches out
nearsightedness

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">R-SLAM pipeline</mark>
	nobody done this in vision science
	
n=comp imaging is all optimization based

why is it so hard for our eyes to focus on one point? 
	fixational eye drift


## the rain of photons onto cones
all the cones are like little sunflowers, theyll poitn to where the light is coming from 
cone absorption depends on the angle of photon arrival 



### the principal of univariance
simple model of a photon detector
wavelength and photoelectric fafect on silicon 
photopigment isomerization event that leads to photo cascade
quantium catch - how many photopigmenst hat attach to ac olor


axon of cone can be extremeley long, especially in the fovea because fovea wants to pack in a lot of photoreceptors, so theres no room for retinal ganglion cells and bipolar cells right in the fovea. 

**how photoreceptor cells respond to light schnapf and baylor 1987**


wald and brown nobel lecture
fred rieke electrophyioligist (MURI project)
	study it ex vivo - from cadaver retina tissue
	put under a microscope
time varying light patterns on the retina
photoelectric effect is very linear
not linear for a cell, cones, cascades, hyperpolarizations

cone micro optics
