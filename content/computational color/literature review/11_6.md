**- For prior art, review the kids of IR-colorized photography, eg on Kolari Vision website, and perhaps in photography art literature. Kodak [Ektachrome] was a famous version of this, and there is a [Kolari article](https://kolarivision.com/the-irchrome-infrared-photography-filter-our-digital-version-of-kodak-aerochrome/) on this topic.**

**IR-colorized photography**
infrared imaging used to be in completely black and white - plain intensity values of the ir in the image
we got false color infrared film, with the most popular being kodak's eir (EKTACHROME PROFESSIONAL INFRARED EIR FILM)
their military version was sold as Aerochrome III

the color rendition was based on exposure and infrared reflectance
but then, they stopped producing the film,

this was all done w analog photography, and now people are trying to do recolorization again with ir photography. some use the same
	yellow #12 filter used in ir color film photographhy
struggled with the same issues of small details of fringing and how to color branches and leaves in the distance

apply yellow filter to the camera, be able to recolorize into an irg image

got a lot of issues during color mixing 
https://kolarivision.com/product/kolari-vision-ir-chrome-lens-filter/
THEN THEY MADE THE KOLARI VISION IR CHROME LENSE FILTER!!!
filter passes the perfect combination of light to create stunning vivid splashes of red on every IR-reflective material



they recolorized the image by applying a filter that allows ir to pass through (at very specific spectrums)
find the right transmission curves (what wavelengths of ir light should we pass in)

## color fringing
![[Pasted image 20231106135653.png]]
https://www.photoreview.com.au/tips/shooting/colour-fringing-explained/
happens for two reasons:
	chromatic aberration 
		if u see color fringing on film, then it is ONLY because of chromatic aberration
	blooming



how are we gonna recolor our images?
little story of how people were photographing in IR previously
next steps: similar to kolari, we already have a filter with nice transmission curves on IR
we want to apply a filter, like yellow #12 onto the images to recolor it
now look into why these are different sizes



our images came in as 143 x 143
first pre crop the original image by ((128 + 15x2) x (128 + 15x2)), equivalent to padding the 128x128 with 15 pixels on both sides
Each cropped image is then processed by get item func in SimpleDataset.py to generate 2 ONS frames.



i need to look at simple dataset and see how they are padding/cropping
then i need to do the same for the tetrachromat dataset and make sure the max padding is 7 not 15

got a new set of better aligned images!!!


2 things we are testing: downsampled vs patch batched. well aligned vs poorly aligned

need to be able to train model with 


can do downsampled vs patch batched on the poorly aligned images and it wont really matter

when i do aligned vs misaligned, can use superglue method vs bad in non superglue method


for now: 
just try to train model 
our images came in as 143 x 143
first pre crop the original image by ((128 + 15x2) x (128 + 15x2)), equivalent to padding the 128x128 with 15 pixels on both sides
Each cropped image is then processed by get item func in SimpleDataset.py to generate 2 ONS frames.


explain this line in SimpleDataset.py
self.N = int(dim_image - params.max_shift_size - params.f_motion_error * 3)


lmsq1 lmsq 2 are optic nerve signals at 2 diff times t
rn we are just doing rgb, but we really wanna be using the cone fundamentals

my max shift size is now 7, but lmsq1 and lmsq2 are still not the same size which is BAD

![[Pasted image 20231106150602.png]]


dim image is 135
self.shift = 7
raw data shape is (107, 143, 4)
lmsq.shape torch.Size([107, 143, 4])
	this is bad, i need the padding to be on all 4 sides
self.N 128
dx 4
dy 5

take the image
resize so the smallest dimension is 158
then crop it so that both dimensions are 158 by 158
