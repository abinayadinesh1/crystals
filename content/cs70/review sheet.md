improvement lemma - every candidate has a job on the string
if you are job optimal, you are candidate pessimal

what is an optimal candidate? look at all the stable pairings and find the one the job liked the best

end of day, any candidates with more than one proposal will cross of their least favorite one
the next day, any jobs that are ‘on the string’ must propose again
