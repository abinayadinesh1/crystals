we can go from protein sequence to structure. how do you go from gene expression to strcuture?

past projects

currently working on
	an ios app to optimize water and fertilizer usage for farmers
		<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">	keep a running doc i can reference to even if there is a long gap in time</mark>
calculate water retention from images of soil
	curate a robust enough dataset to prove that this works
proxy for soil aggregation using color vision
<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">building a multispectral camera</mark>
