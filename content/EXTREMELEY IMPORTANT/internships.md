meet big boss from ambrook research, figure out what theyre working on 
apple
	[[email to john 11_16]]
	
sakuna.ai 
reach out to people from google brain? 


- be homies with the big boss
- do my homework
- dont ask for trial
- be extremeley confident when it comes to outreach




plan to get apple health is to:
- reach out again on november 10
- share progress on the project, mainly the hardware portions of it
	- "building the app was amazing, but to make it more accurate, I developed a multi-sensor system to take controlled pictures of the soil and get moisture, temperature, and humidity measurements that confirm the results of the color analyzer."
	- this venture into hardware and sensor fusion has been extremely rewarding, so I'd love to hear about Apple Health's vision for using the Apple Watch and other parts of the ecosystem for better health monitoring!
- get a function system, process data.
