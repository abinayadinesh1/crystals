	integrate field and lab measurements with imaging spectroscopy (airborne HySpex sensor), LiDAR, and biological modeling (BioSIM model)
	what kinds of questions are driving your work?
	think its really cool how u guys are doing imaging spectroscopy of plants
		can u do this to measure nutrient content?
	what went into making the hyspex sensor and what dev does it need now
	what are the commercial directions u might take for this?
	do u guys do any measurements of greenhouses gases/carbon flux?
	coolest thing on top of this would be doing micribial biology/sequencing on top of this

sunday
10-10pm hackathon
- leave w samarth at 10
- gautum at 1pm 
- maybe running w alice (past 4)

run trained compneuro model
	just scale down the image andrew gave
	could train the whole thing on my own, but why ?
look into eoin's data and literature
submit lab9


need dataset of images
need to crop and load it into folder
need to train model 

can use radiative transfer models to tell
[temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) or [humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity "Humidity")
