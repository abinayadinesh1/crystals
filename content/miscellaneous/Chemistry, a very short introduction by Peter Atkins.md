## its origins, scope, and organization
chemistry was born out of a quest for two things, a way to:
1. manipulate matter to produce elixirs that make people live longer
2. manipulate anything resembling gold (urine, sand, lead) into gold

- what transformed chemistry from alchemy to a science was the invention of the **balance**: measuring things precisely assigned numbers to concepts, enabling rigorous testing and experimentation.

- John Dalton came up with the atom by measuring substances before and after transformation and realizing they were always made up of unchanging components. 
- >2 atoms makes a molecule
- A 'transformation' of a substance is a divorce and remarriage between the atoms that make it up.
- The two main concepts chemistry imports from physics are that of microscopic and macroscopic worlds
	- *microscopic* - relating to the behavior of individual atoms and their subatomic particles. 
		- This relies heavily on quantum mechanics, because Newton's classical mechanics that explain the motion of large bodies fails at the level of atoms. 
	- *macroscopic* - relating to bulk, large versions of this matter (like a jug of water of block of iron)
		- This relies on thermodynamics, the study of energy and its transformations.
- Chemistry is divided into 3 branches:
	- Physical:
		- how are atoms and molecules formed?
		- what determines their role, how they use their energy, and the rate of reaction?
	- Chemical:
		- studying the behavior of all molecules not including carbon
		- subsividisions include that of **solid state chemistry** and **organometallic chemistry**. 
	- Organic:
		- Carbon is indifferent to who and how it makes its bonds, allowing it to bond with itself and form complex chains and rings.
