Researchers at AIFARMS have found that, by training a neural net on datasets collected by both **soil and satellite sensors**, they can track cover-cropping yields across entire growing regions. By interpreting **images that use the entire electromagnetic spectrum**, the model also enables **remote monitoring of organic carbon and nitrogen levels in soil (SOC)**.
