had a period where we kept getting blasted by rocks/asteroids/meteroids and the earth was SUPER hot
these came with minerals like blank and blank
earth cooled down at some point allowing life to start forming
	how does snowball earth tie into this?
at some point, we have oxygen, photosynthesis, and TONS of rock. even though life couldve boomed here, instead, the rock reacted with the oxygen to form rust. the main organisms rn are chemolithotrophs that get energy from electrons in rock instead of photosynthesis (sun splits water which reacts with co2 which forms carbohydrate plus oxygen)

plate tectonics are needed to make volcanos, which end the snowball worth and maintain our temperature

jill banfield studies deep acid mines, deep sea events, thermal events like in yellowstone. the microbes metabolism rate stay slow so they dont dominate.

upper 100km of our earth is where plates are moving

flat irons in colorodo are totally vertical
sedimentary rocks, but over time forces lifted them up. 
2 continental plates running together

big trucks that get on the earth and go boom

position of continents affect how heat is distributed
thermal a line breaking down south of greenland. 
energy balance is how much light is absorbed and reflected. circulation changes in oceans. 

what are the multiple lines of evidence for plates moving
multiple lines for the big bang?
