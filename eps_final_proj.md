why is this important
1. it is really freaking hard to map land practices to soil carbon and greenhouse gases
	1. current ways to figure out how much carbon is in your soil 
		1. carbon footprint calculator like agrecalc
		2. uses life cycle assessment (LCA) framework for estimating emissions from products and processes
		3. it being easy to use often means its not specific enough to capture useful information ? ![[Screenshot 2023-11-08 at 7.30.04 PM.png]]
focused on inputs, not on systems of productions
	big farmers have enough profit and enough data to ask for government for ways to measure the impact of their farms on the climate. the government's response to this will be specific to the needs of their customers. 

who is this for

why is this useful?
	farmer
		can market their goods as 
	government: 
		if this were to be certified and legitimatized
			 the government can make this the standard way to measure success of GHG emission reduction programs
			 gov can know what land practices actually decrease GHG emissions
				 they can fund more of the projects that implement these land practices
		 
			 
				 



what does it do?
pick a position on the map and a point in time, see how many greenhouse gases that place emits
filter for farms only
	see what is on that land, how it is being used
	link to the farmer's website and to buy things from their farm
see filter of farms by size
	see summary statistics of farms by size
	summary statistics by land practices
how do i get a map of only farms in america?

how does it work?
	collect ghg info at every latitude and longitude using open source satellite info 
	use datasets on land usage / land ownership
		or computer vision to classify sizes of farms - not always correlated to who owns them and how they are
		get into details on specific land practices
			use google maps to find exactly what farm is there
			search the web for stuff related to that farm
			synthesis into land practices of that farm 
			
			 <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> are there llms that can search the web?</mark>
	

what would it require? what datasets are there to help us? 
NASAâ€™s OCO-2
Japanese GOSAT missions

what are farmers asking for, and how might the government respond? 

is this what is important?
	all goes back into another metric to optimize for: better agriculture is not from people optimizing for certain metrics. better agriculture comes from: 1) understanding the climate, topography, geology, conditions of the land you are on. 2) understanding the native species and crop types that will be able to benefit your soil, while still producing food (less extractive, more healing). 2) sharing resources with farmers in your area on specific practices and methods to reduce input costs and create closed loop systems. 
what is really important?  
	how do we get farmers talking to each other and training one another. in many places it will be really hard to find people with the site specific knowledge they need. also, big farmers wont be receptive to change (is this true?) because they grow subsidized crops and use subsidized inputs. 
why should this still exist?
	since information is derived from the orbit of a satellite (and the sampling of info is the same)
how would this work?
	build a metric that can be used for all sections of land (in a specific region that we have data for)
	sample and integrate over a section of land to find the average ghg emissions of that place
	consumers: can search up where their food was grown and find out how many greenhouse gases that place emits
		problem: most dont know what farms grow their food
	


	and really is far away from the exact land practices being implemented.
	can only see a net effect
	what is actually important is the development of social movements that make people food sovereign. 

"what impacts the amount of greenhouse gases seen from a satellite?"

statistics between land usage and greenhouse gas emissions


 where does your food comes from
	search a farm name, get statistics about it
	relative statistics to other 
	
simulate how greenhouse gas emissions have changed over location and over time

[National Land Cover Database (NLCD)](https://www.usgs.gov/node/279743)
uses anderson classification system: https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/r5/landmanagement/resourcemanagement/?cid=fsbdev3_048169

 [C-CAP High-Resolution Land Cover and Change](https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/ccaphighres.html)
unfortuantely does not have for all areas
only for coasts?
