The war in Ukraine lead to a third global shock in food prices due to unresolved weaknesses in our food systems. During the war, famers only planted 1/3 of their normal spring crop, normal supply chains for transporting food were disrupted by fighting, and millions of people were displaced to new places, without access to their normal means of food. 
Ukraine and Russia are some of the biggest grain exporters and their inability to provide for the globe, as well as export restrictions in other countries to reduce domestic inflation and panic buying all led to a 34% increase in the price in food, compared to the previous year. 

The main recipients of Ukraine and Russia exports are Africa, Eritrea, Somalia, and the Dominican Republic of Congo, where their diets, culture, and economic positions lead to a huge consumption of wheat/grain products. While the main issues were only with wheat/grain exports, the price volatility is spilling over to other commodity crops like soy, maize, and rice as countries are battling for mass produced goods to feed their nations. It has been reported that the global number of malnourished people will increase by 13.1 million because of this, with disproportionate impacts in the Asia-Pacific and Sub Saharan Africa. 

1. Food import dependencies
2. Path dependencies in production systems
3. Opaque, dysfunctional, and speculation-prone grain markets; and
4. Vicious cycles of conflict, climate change, poverty, and food insecurity
