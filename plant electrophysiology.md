sensors u can get for measuring plant information:
https://phyto-sensor.com/
	CO2 exchange, transpiration and stomatal conductance (size of stomatal aperture dictates gas and water uptake)
	- Leaf Temperature
	-Sap flow
	- Steam Diameter
	- Fruit Growth
	- Auxanometer
	- Pyranometer
	- Quantum sensor



**plant nervous systems as environmental sensors for data collection**
	use electrochemical signals to tell what the plants internal nervous system is
		environmental sensors? tell stuff about the environment based on what the plant is saying
			why is this better than just using an environmental sensor? plant tells u stuff that u couldnt get from the environment
		how do u get the signals
		decoding of electrochemical signals from diverse plant species
- Process and analyze continuous time series data (biosignals similar to EEG), which have been recorded  from plants, to decode meaningful patterns and insights about multiple randomly timed and overlapping multimodal stimuli in the plant’s environment.
- Collaborate with experts across disciplines (botany, electrophysiology, and so on) to understand and improve the data analysis process.
- Assist in the design of field trials and lab experiments.
- Assist in designing our distributed experimentation and collaborative fieldwork initiatives.
- Stay updated with the latest research in biosignal processing, machine learning, and related fields.
